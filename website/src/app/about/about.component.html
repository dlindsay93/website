      <p>Welcome to my website. My name is David Lindsay and I am Mechannical Engineering graduate trying to learn about many aspects of software development. I was intriduced to software development when working on
      a project using python that would scape stock market data from various websites and use relevant studies to determine the preformance of each stock in the future. I began exploring software more seriously at the 2018
      SXSW Hackathon where I worked with a team of developers to make a Distributed Application (dapp) called 8trac that would be deployed on the Ethereum Network. Since then I have explored more deeply into smart contracts and blockchain
      technology. Recenly I have been learning Angular to work on my web development skills and hope that this website will display all the relevant skills I have learned using this framework. Thank you for visiting my site and feel free
      to contact me with any comments or questions.
